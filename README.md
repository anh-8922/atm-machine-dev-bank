# DevBank ATM Machine App

## Overview

The **DevBank ATM Machine App** is a web application built using React.js, designed to simulate an ATM machine experience. This application allows users to enter their PIN, check their account balance, and make withdrawals. The project was undertaken as part of a coding challenge and is a great example of using React.js to create a functional and interactive web application.

## Features

- **PIN Verification**: Users are required to enter their PIN (1111), which is checked against a PIN API to authenticate the user.

- **Account Balance Display**: Upon successful authentication, the user's current account balance is retrieved from the API and displayed on the screen.

- **Withdrawals**: Users can make up to three withdrawals, each for a specific amount.

- **Notes Dispensing**: The ATM machine dispenses the appropriate mix of notes (e.g., £5, £10, £20) based on the withdrawal amount and the available notes in the machine.

- **Overdraft Protection**: The ATM allows an overdraft of up to £100 and notifies users if they go overdrawn.

- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests using Jest have been written to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.
